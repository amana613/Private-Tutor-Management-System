# Private-Tutor-Management-System
A web-based platform that streamlines private tutoring by managing student enrollment, class scheduling, announcements, progress tracking,  and fee management.

The Class Slot Management module is designed to make scheduling and student management effortless for tutors. Tutors can quickly add students from Grades 1 to 5, assign them to specific class days and times, and the system automatically updates and organizes schedules according to enrollment. This ensures that each studentâ€™s timetable is clear, conflicts are avoided, and overall class management becomes seamless.

The Announcements module enhances communication between tutors, students, and parents by enabling instant notifications. Tutors can send important messages, updates, or reminders to all students and parents with a single click, reducing the need for manual follow-ups and ensuring everyone stays informed in real-time.
